      <p>
        I'm a third year student currently studying B. Sc. (Hons) in Computing at 
        Softwarica College of IT and E-commerce in affiliation 
        with Coventry University. 
        Software development is a fulfilling and rewarding job for me. 
        I love to execute big ideas, 
        and I want to use my talents to solve problems and make life easier for people. 
        I jump at the chance to learn new things. 
        I take great pride in my work and the fact that I create things that others find useful.

            <p>
                Gyanodaya Bal Batika is well introduced as a school with fair renown, 
                contributing to the upliftment of the educational standards for over four decades. 
                The school was founded by Mrs Indira Yakthumba in solemn tribute to her husband His Excellency Late Gyan Bahadur Yakthumba, 
                a true patriot of Nepal, a multi-faceted personality, a fighter for democracy, 
                human rights and justice, a diplomat and the first inspector general of police from the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gyanodaya Bal Batika is located at Bungamati/ Khokana, Lalitpur amid a tranquil, 
                naturally divine ambience, conducive to peaceful teaching and learning. 
                The immaculate infrastructure and the huge, green, eco-friendly premises with all the futuristic facilities 
                are what make Gyanodaya a comprehensive educational institute at the top of the list of the best schools in Nepal.
            </p>
            <p>
                After studying in such a well renown school of Nepal for 13 years,
                I finally graduated my SLC (School Leaving Certificate), now known as SEE, in 2011
                with 78% of marks in aggregate.

            <p>
              After graduating my school, I enrolled in White House Higher Secondary College which is located 
              at Satdobato, Lalitpur. With so many faculties available in the college, at that time I choose to 
              study faculty of Hotel Management and now I tend to realize why I choose faculty of hotel management, 
              if I was going to study IT in future. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Without thinking about what I was going to do study in near future, I graduated my Secondary level of 
            education in hotel management in 2013 with just 58% in aggregate which I still feel very emabarassed to tell 
            infront of others.

              Graduating secondary level of eduacation was just not enough for me. I was not still
              sure at that moment what I'm going to be doing in my future. Then I got a suggestion 
              from my Uncle, who told me to study IT in Softwarica College of IT and E-commerce and 
              I feel like I had made a right decision at that time agreeing with my uncle and joining 
              this college.
            </p>
            <p>
              After 2 years of studying in Softwarica I graduated diploma and advanced diploma course in 
              Computing with merit grades. And now I'm studying my final years which I am very much excited 
              about.

            that capturing a moment gives us that opportunity to look back and relive that moment.
            With this feeling me and two of my friends started a small start-up company, naming it Drishya 
            Enterprises with the moto of "Capturing the moment" and then my photography journey began and still
            it continues till today.

            While I was studying my Diploma degree, I wanted to gain some experience too. 
            So I worked as a part time Computer Lap Instructer at National School of Sciences, 
            where I got to gain some knowledge and experience about, how an educational institute
            runs.

            I am always eager to learn new things and gain new experience. So just to gain some experience
            and to increase my comunicating skills I worked as a sales person in my fathers shop for 1 year.
            It was actually very enjoyable learning experience for me because as sales person you get to interact
            with different types of people.
